Here‚Äôs a neat README.md for your weather terminal app:

# Weather Terminal App

A simple Python command-line app to fetch and display real-time weather data using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).  

Built for fun, with colorful terminal output powered by [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/).

---

##  Features
- Get live weather updates by typing the city name.  
- Shows:
  -  Temperature (in Celsius)  
  -  Humidity  
  -  Weather condition description  
- Corrects city names automatically (thanks to API).  
- Handles errors gracefully (invalid city, no internet, etc.).  
- Color-coded output for a better terminal experience.  

---

##  Requirements
Make sure you have Python 3 installed.  
Then install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests colorama

API Key Setup

This app uses the OpenWeatherMap API.

Sign up at OpenWeatherMap
 to get a free API key.

Replace the placeholder inside the code:

API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"


‚ö† For security, it‚Äôs better to store this in environment variables (future improvement).

‚ñ∂Usage

Run the app from your terminal:

python weather.py


You‚Äôll see:

=== Weather Terminal App ===
(Type exit to quit)

Enter city: London


Example output:

Weather in London, GB
Temperature: 18¬∞C
Humidity: 67 %
Condition: Clear sky

 Exit Options

Type any of these to quit the program:

exit | quit | bye | q

Future Improvements

 Move API key to environment variables.

 Add wind speed & ‚Äúfeels like‚Äù temperature.

 Support for 5-day forecast.

 Add timeout & retry for requests.

Do you want me to also add a **cool ASCII banner** (like `Weather App üå¶Ô∏è`) at the top of the README for style, or keep it clean and minimal?
